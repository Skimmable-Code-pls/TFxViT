### Road map
- [ ] Rewrite torch model in tensorflow and test it with dummy input. Then compare to original torch model
- [ ] Test with inference image and post some qualitative result here. Then compare to original torch model
- [ ] Test it with validation loss and post the loss plot here. Then compare to original torch model
- [ ] Test with inference for Accuracy, mIoU, F1, Recall. Then compare to original torch model

### Model zoo
- [ ] Swin and ViT. Will steal from [this repo](https://github.com/sayakpaul/swin-transformers-tf/tree/main) for starters
- [ ] Swin x MAE, inspire from [Swin-MAE repo](https://github.com/Zian-Xu/Swin-MAE)
